This is the second such seizure in the state by police within a week. According to reports, the drone found was partially damaged and recovered in Mahawa village based on the information given by one of the four people the state police arrested on Sunday. They are allegedly part of a terror module of the Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF).\r\n\r\nAccording to a report by news agency PTI, police official informed that due to a malfunction, the drone could not return to Pakistan and so the accused hid it in a village near the Attari border.  Earlier, the police had recovered a half-burnt drone on Tuesday from Tarn Taran. They had said it was also used to drop weapons from Pakistan to fuel unrest in Punjab and adjoining states.\r\n\r\nAkashdeep, one of the four arrestees whose interrogation led to the latest seizure, also accompanied a State Special Operations Cell (SSOC) team of the Punjab Police to the site from where the drone was recovered. Militants of KZF had revealed that four drones, from across the border, are hidden around Punjab’s Tarn Taran and its surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nPolice officials said the second drone was damaged and it could not fly back to Pakistan after delivering the consignment of weapon. However, they did not show the drone to the media. The state police had on Sunday claimed to have busted the terror module of the KZF, which is backed by a group based in Pakistan and Germany.\r\n\r\nFour members of the module -- Balwant Singh alias Nihang, Akashdeep Singh alias Akash Randhawa, Harbhajan Singh and Balbir Singh -- were arrested near Chohla Sahib village in Tarn Taran.\r\n\r\nFive AK-47 rifles, 16 magazines and 472 rounds of ammunition, four Chinese-made 30 bore pistols, along with eight magazines and 72 rounds of ammunition; nine hand grenades, five satellite phones with their ancillary equipment, two mobile phones, two wireless sets and fake currency with the face value of Rs 10 lakh were recovered from them.\r\n\r\n<em>(With additional inputs from PTI)</em>\r\n\r\n<iframe class=\"vidfyVideo\" style=\"border: 0px;\" src=\"http://api.niklive.in/index.php/playmedia/wordpress/1148388bfbe9d9953fea775ecb3414c4/e4bb8c8e71139e0bd4911c0942b15236/dmlkLTE1Njk0Mjk2MTgxNDE0NDIxNDU0?embed=1\" width=\"631\" height=\"381\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>","post_title":"Pakistani Drone In Punjab Found After KZF Terrorist Reveals Location","post_type":"post","post_author":"sahils","_thumbnail_id":"https://static.niklive.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/27171317/drone-getty-580x395.jpg","post_url":"https://www.niklive.in/india-news/pakistani-drone-in-punjab-found-after-kzf-terrorist-reveals-location-1081955","post_modified":"2019-09-27T17:19:04+05:30","post_date":"2019-09-27T17:13:39+05:30","ad_disable":false,"auther-name":"nik News Bureau","is_forum_topic":false,"main_title":"Another Pakistani Drone Found In Punjab After Terror Accused Reveals Location; Search Ops Underway","category":["india-news"],"category_name":["INDIA"],"post_tag":["drones-in-punjab","pakistan","terrorism"],"post_tag_name":["Drones in Punjab","Pakistan","terrorism"],"post_format":[],"is_filmymonkey":"","comprehend":null,"all_category_data":[{"id":13205,"name":"INDIA","slug":"india-news"}]},"sort":[1569584619000]},{"_index":"english","_type":"post","_id":"1081849","_score":null,"_source":{"blog_id":1,"post_content":"After the 'Bigg Boss 12' ex contestant Deepak Thakur, now another former Bigg Boss contestant is set to enter Vikas Gupta's show's second season.

Set in 1419, the grandeur of the sets will surely leave you impressed.\r\n\r\nThe trailer showcases two timelines of 1419 and 2019 running parallel to each other. Akshay and Bobby are warriors in 1419, while Riteish is a dance teacher by the name Bhangdu Maharaj. On the other hand, the three leading ladies Pooja, Kriti, and Kriti Kharbanda are pretty princesses whose father Ranjeet organises a 'Swayamvar' for his daughters in order to find the right groom for them.\r\n\r\nThe trailer is packed with the usual 'Housefull' kind of jokes. For example, in one of the scenes Riteish who is a dancer tells Pooja, \"Phulo phalo, phulo phalo, arre kone mein toh chalo!\" which will bring back the memories of the earlier installments of the franchise.\r\n\r\nRana Daggubati will be seen playing the antagonist for the first time in the installment. His rustic, rugged look adds the right bit of intrigue in an otherwise fun trailer.\r\n\r\nLater, In 2019, the characters set out to undercover the truth about their past, while engaging in usual peculiar humour and random sword-fights with each other.\r\n\r\nJohnny Lever will be seen recreating charm again with his one-liners and situational comedy which will surely keep you glued to your seats. Apart from him, the trailer also shows a glimpse of Nawazuddin Siddiqui who will be exploring the comedy genre for the first time. The ace actor is seen imitating his own character from the film 'Kick' with the same laugh and dialogue delivery.\r\n\r\nThe trailer also gives a glimpse of Chunky Pandey who has always remained a vital part of the 'Housefull' installment, leaving an impact in between scenes with his perfect comic timing.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, Akshay unveiled the character posters from the film. The posters show the characters in elaborate old-world costumes as well as in modern setting. The two posters featuring Akshay show him portraying dual roles of Rajkumar Bala and Harry in the film. The first poster shows Akshay in an intriguing warrior avatar, wielding a bow and arrow.\r\n\r\nThe next posters shared by Akshay feature Riteish Deshmukh as Bangdu and Roy.\r\n\r\nRiteish seems to be playing the role of a dancer. The posters show Riteish with long hair, striking a dance pose in one and interacting with his new-age counterpart in another.\r\n\r\nThe third set of posters introduce Bobby Deol as Dharamputra and Max. The posters show Bobby as an armoured warrior, wielding a sword, with an intense look on his face. His present-day avatar is called Max.\r\n\r\nAkshay also introduced Kriti Sanon's dual characters -- Rajkumari Madhu and Kriti.\r\n\r\nIn the first poster, Kriti can be seen in a regal avatar, dressed up in a fancy lehenga and ornate jewellery. Her modern-day avatar looks a lot like her usual self.\r\n\r\nSporting a lehenga, traditional jewellery, and a veil, Kriti looks beautiful as Rajkumari Madhu. In the second poster she can be seen rocking the modern look carrying a denim jacket on her shoulder.\r\n\r\nRevolving around the theme of reincarnation, the film follows a non-linear narrative.

Naveen Kumar and Vijay secured Super 10s for the Delhi side who move back to the top of the points table after the victory.</strong>\r\n\r\nPatna will only have themselves to blame for the loss after having dominated the match for the most part. Pardeep Narwal once again impressed with a Super 10 (19 points) for the Pirates but a blunder in the defence by three-time champions Patna allowed Delhi's Vijay to clinch 5 points in a raid and make a comeback in the match.\r\n\r\nConsidering the quality of raiders on both sides of the mat, it wasn't surprising to see both the defences take a cautious approach in the early minutes of the encounter. When they did try, they failed as Pardeep and Naveen made the match all about themselves. But Chandan Ranjit, Delhi's secondary raider, picked up important points in the background, and the pressure finally mounted when in the 11th minute Vijay pulled off a stellar block on Patna's Pardeep to sway the balance towards the Delhi side.\r\n\r\nPardeep's time away from the mat is usually the make-or-break factor for the Patna team but despite the star spending a large time away (8 minutes 25 seconds) from the action, the team kept pace with the Delhi side, with Hadi Oshtorak marshalling the defence. The first half ended with no All-Outs and points tied at 13-13.\r\n\r\nThe Delhi side started the second half with a Super Tackle on Pardeep but that was perhaps their only positive move in the next minutes as Patna unleashed the beast in them. Quick raids fetched them an All-Out in the fourth minute of the second-half after which Pardeep steamrolled through a hapless Delhi defence. The superstar picked up another Super 10, and a three-point Super Raid in the 8th minute of the half, as Patna pushed for another All-Out.\r\n\r\nThey got their second All-Out with six minutes remaining to move to a six-point lead. ‘Record breaker' Pardeep also became the first raider to hit 1100 points in PKL history with his efforts. But Kabaddi is a sport that doesn't allow you to rest on your laurels, and a raid by Delhi's Vijay with slightly more than three minutes left in the match turned things around once again.

I get all the responsibility, because it happened under my watch,\" the Crown Prince, also known as MBS, told American public broadcaster PBS, according to a preview of a documentary to be aired on October 1, ahead of the first anniversary of the journalist's death.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince, however, reiterated that the incident happened without his knowledge, Anadolu news agency reported citing the broadcaster.\r\n\r\nThe documentary, \"The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia\", examines the Saudi leader's rise, his rule and ties to the events surrounding Khashoggi's murder.\r\n\r\nKhashoggi -- a supporter-turned-critic of the Crown Prince and a Washington Post columnist -- was killed and reportedly dismembered in October 2018 by a team of 15 agents sent from Riyadh. His body has not been found till now.\r\n\r\nHe was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018 to obtain papers he needed to marry his Turkish fiancee. His mysterious death piled scrutiny on Saudi Arabia, which released conflicting information regarding his disappearance in the aftermath.\r\n\r\nSaudi authorities have since blamed a \"rogue\" operation for his murder and put 11 men on trial.\r\n\r\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and some Western governments said the Crown Prince ordered it, but Saudi officials said that he had no role.\r\n\r\nAsked by a correspondent from PBS' Frontline programme that how the killing could take place without MBS knowing about it, the Crown Prince said: \"We have 20 million people. We have 3 million government employees.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they can take one of your planes?\" the correspondent asked the Crown Prince, referring to the 15-person team said to have been behind Khashoggi's killing and dismemberment that flew in and out of Istanbul on jets owned by the Saudi government.\r\n\r\n\"I have officials, Ministers to follow things, and they're responsible. They have the authority to do that,\" the Crown Prince replied.\r\n\r\nThe documentary also features never-before-seen interview footage of Khashoggi months before his death, explaining how he went from being a supporter of the Crown Prince to a critic.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to be a dissident, but in the same time, I don't want to go back home and be silent again,\" Khashoggi had said.","post_title":"Khashoggi Murder Happened 'Under My Watch': Saudi Crown Prince Breaks Silence","post_type":"post","post_author":"shubhray","_thumbnail_id":"https://static.niklive.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/26164048/000_1KE350-580x395.jpg","post_url":"https://www.niklive.in/world-news/khashoggi-murder-happened-under-my-watch-saudi-crown-prince-breaks-silence-1081339","post_modified":"2019-09-26T16:41:06+05:30","post_date":"2019-09-26T16:41:03+05:30","ad_disable":false,"auther-name":"IANS","is_forum_topic":false,"main_title":"Khashoggi Murder Happened 'Under My Watch': Saudi Crown Prince Breaks Silence","category":["world-news"],"category_name":["WORLD"],"post_tag":["jamal-khashoggi","mohammed-bin-salman","saudi-arabia","uae"],"post_tag_name":["Jamal Khashoggi","Mohammed bin Salman","saudi arabia","uae"],"post_format":[],"is_filmymonkey":"","comprehend":null,"all_category_data":[{"id":13206,"name":"WORLD","slug":"world-news"}]},"sort":[1569496263000]},{"_index":"english","_type":"post","_id":"1081293","_score":null,"_source":{"blog_id":1,"post_content":"All the celebrities that we see shining bright on television and the big screen have achieved success through years of hard work and dedication.

Speaking to nik News, Browne assured that Choksi will be extradited to India after he exhausts all his legal appeals in the country. \"We are a country of laws, the matter is before the judiciary,\" Browne said.\r\n\r\n\"He (Choksi) has several appeals, and until he exhausts his appeals there is nothing we can do,\" said the Antigua PM, describing Choksi as a crook. Browne also said that Indian officials are free to investigate him. \"I can assure you that he will be ultimately deported to India after exhausting all his appeals. He will be extradited back to India to face whatever charges made against him. It is just a matter of time,\" Browne told news agency ANI.\r\n\r\nChoksi is a wanted figure in India in the <span class=\"rupee\">Rs.</span> 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam, who was granted citizenship in the Caribbean nation in January, 2018. The Caribbean PM also said that India authorities have the right to come to Antigua and Barbuda to interrogate him. \"They can come and if they wish to interview Choksi based on his willingness to participate, it has nothing to do with my government,\" Browne added.\r\n\r\nBrowne also pointed out that it is unfortunate that Choksi was cleared by Indian officials as a person in 'good standing' only to be told later that he is a crook. \"In any case, our officials acted based on the information from India and made him a citizen... the Indian officials have to take the responsibility for that situation,\" the Antigua Prime Minister said.\r\n\r\n\"Got subsequent information that Mehul Choksi is a crook, he does not add value to our country. He will be deported ultimately after he exhausts appeals. Indian officials are free to investigate based on his willingness to participate,\" Browne told while speaking to ANI.\r\n\r\nBoth Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi fled the country almost a year ago and are key accused in the much controversial PNB fraud case. On June 17, Choksi had submitted an affidavit in the Bombay High Court, stating that he is residing in Antigua and was willing to co-operate in the investigation in the PNB scam.\r\n\r\n<iframe class=\"vidfyVideo\" style=\"border: 0px;\" src=\"https://api.niklive.in/index.php/playmedia/wordpress/1148388bfbe9d9953fea775ecb3414c4/e4bb8c8e71139e0bd4911c0942b15236/dmlkLTE1Njk0NjgxNDkzNDk1MjU2Mzg?embed=1\" width=\"631\" height=\"381\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>","post_title":"Mehul Choksri Antigua PM Says Extradition Just A Matter Of Time","post_type":"post","post_author":"sahils","_thumbnail_id":"https://static.niklive.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/26140836/m-580x395.jpg","post_url":"https://www.niklive.in/india-news/mehul-choksri-antigua-pm-says-extradition-just-a-matter-of-time-1081162","post_modified":"2019-09-26T14:09:49+05:30","post_date":"2019-09-26T14:09:46+05:30","ad_disable":false,"auther-name":"nik News Bureau","is_forum_topic":false,"main_title":"Antigua PM Terms Mehul Choksi A Crook, Says Indian Authorities Free To Investigate Him","category":["india-news"],"category_name":["INDIA"],"post_tag":["gaston-browne","mehul-choksi","pnb-scam"],"post_tag_name":["Gaston Browne","Mehul Choksi","pnb scam"],"post_format":[],"is_filmymonkey":"","comprehend":null,"all_category_data":[{"id":13205,"name":"INDIA","slug":"india-news"}]},"sort":[1569487186000]},{"_index":"english","_type":"post","_id":"1081189","_score":null,"_source":{"blog_id":"1","post_content":"New Delhi: Agitated over his comment mocking party leader Manoj Tiwari, BJP workers this afternoon held a massive protest outside Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's residence. Police made use of water cannons to disperse the agitators of BJP's Purvanchal Morcha who came in large numbers and turned violent. Visuals showed protesters scaling over barricades installed by police personnel, while fluttering banners and raising anti-Kejriwal slogans. Reports say a number of protesters were detained and shoved into a police van.\r\n\r\nKejriwal on Wednesday said if the National Register of Citizens (NRC) was implemented in the national capital, state BJP chief Manoj Tiwari would have to leave the city. \"If the NRC was implemented in Delhi, Tiwari will have to leave Delhi first,\" the Chief Minister at a press conference.\r\n\r\nKejriwal’s response came over a question that Tiwari had alleged rise in criminal activities in Delhi due to illegal migrants.\r\n\r\nTiwari has been actively demanding for NRC to be implemented in Delhi on the lines of Assam.\r\n\r\nReacting to the chief minister’s remark, Tiwari said it had exposed Kejriwal's real face and alleged, he wanted to evict migrants from UP and Bihar.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hRu64_zfRE\r\n\r\nEarlier this week, Tiwari had told news agency IANS the NRC was important as there was no record of illegal foreign migrants in the city and termed them a threat to the nation and the people.\"There's no record of illegal migrants. They commit crime and may also indulge in anti-national activities. It's a security threat to people and the country,\" Tiwari said.\r\n\r\nThe NRC, he said would only target people from outside the country. \"Indians, from any part of the country, living in Delhi will not be affected in any form. The issue will be only for illegal foreign migrants.\"\r\n\r\nLeader of opposition in the Delhi assembly Vijender Gupta also demanded that the Kejriwal government needs to come out with a white paper on Bangladeshi and Rohingya \"illegal immigrants\".\r\n\r\nAAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj asked Tiwari to prove he had been a Delhi resident since 1971 by showing legal documents.\"The BJP wants to bring the NRC to throw out people from Bihar and UP who come here to work. In the NRC, only those who have documents to prove that they are staying in Delhi from before 1971 would be considered Delhi residents. I want to ask Tiwari to show us proof that he has been staying in Delhi from the years before 1971 and if he can show that then let them bring the NRC for Delhi,\" Bharadwaj said.\r\n\r\nHe also said in the past few days, Delhi BJP leaders had started showing concern for people from UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand or Odisha. \"They constitute nearly half of Delhi's population. The BJP wants to throw them out of Delhi,\" Bharadwaj said.","post_title":"BJP Purvanchal Morcha Protest Outside Kejriwal Residence In Delhi Over NRC","post_type":"post","post_author":"Dheeraj Chandrashekar","_thumbnail_id":"https://static.niklive.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/26133455/BJP-1-580x395.jpg","post_url":"https://www.niklive.in/india-news/bjp-purvanchal-morcha-protest-outside-kejriwal-residence-in-delhi-over-nrc-1081189","post_modified":"2019-09-26T16:26:56+05:30","post_date":"2019-09-26T13:40:02+05:30","ad_disable":false,"auther-name":"nik News Bureau","is_forum_topic":false,"main_title":"BJP Protests Outside Arvind Kejriwal's Residence For Swipe At Manoj Tiwari Over NRC","category":["india-news"],"category_name":["INDIA"],"post_tag":["arvind-kejriwal","bjp","bjp-protest","delhi","kejriwal-residence","nrc"],"post_tag_name":["arvind kejriwal","BJP","BJP protest","Delhi","kejriwal residence","NRC"],"post_format":[],"is_filmymonkey":"","comprehend":null,"all_category_data":[{"id":13205,"name":"INDIA","slug":"india-news"}]},"sort":[1569485402000]},{"_index":"english","_type":"post","_id":"1081166","_score":null,"_source":{"blog_id":1,"post_content":"<strong>Mumbai: </strong>Actor Akshay Kumar has shared a beautiful photograph on his daughter Nitara's seventh birthday and said that she is happiest when she is in her \"daddy's arms.\" The \"Kesari\" star took to social media on Wednesday evening to share an image of himself carrying his daughter in his arms, as he seems to climb a wooden structure.

Speaking at the  Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) programme in New York on the sidelines of United Nations General Assembly, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said, \"You have terrorism in different parts of world but there is no part of world where a country uses it consciously and deliberately as a large scale industry against its neighbor.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked about whether India wants to have a dialogue with Pakistan on issues of dispute, Jaishankar said, \"Issue is not whether to talk or not, everybody wants to talk to their neighbor. Issue is how do I talk to a country that is conducting terrorism &amp; follows a policy of implausible deniability.\"\r\n\r\nFurther speaking upon the hotbed issue of Kashmir and abrogation of Article 370 in the state, Jaishankar said the level of intimidation had reached a height where senior police officers were lynched on streets of Srinagar, journalists who wrote against separatism were assassinated, military personnel returning home for Eid were kidnapped and killed.\r\n\r\n\"Before August 5 (Abrogation of Article 370), Kashmir was in a mess, difficulties in Kashmir did not start on August 5, it is supposed to be a way of dealing with those difficulties,\" EAM added.\r\n\r\n\"You have a neighbour who will not trade with you, who is member of World Trade Organization (WTO) and before that of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) but will not extend Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status even though they are legally obliged,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHitting at Pakistan further on the issue of trade and other cooperative measures, Jaishankar said, \"You have a neighbor who will not allow you connectivity...who in many ways has slowed down regionalism because of concern that it might integrate them more with our economy...who filters people to people interaction. It's a very challenging neighbor.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had experience of 2016 when a self advertised terrorist cult figure was killed, a gentleman called Burhan Wani, after that there was spike in violence. Our intention was to manage the situation (post Article 370) without loss of life, restrictions were intended to do that,\" Jaishankar pointed while addressing a presser.\r\n\r\nEven spokesperson of Ministry of External Affairs, Raveesh Kumar held a separate press conference and once again clarified India's stand and United State President Donald Trump's remarks on mediation. \"Even yesterday he (President Trump) said that India and Pakistan should both agree for any kind of mediation. Our position is very clear, it has been articulated by the Prime Minister earlier, that position remains,\" Kumar said.\r\n\r\n\"Discussion between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump regarding Jammu and Kashmir, yesterday, was in the context of counter-terrorism.

Swamy, a former Union Law and Commerce Minister, on Wednesday launched his latest book \"RESET -- Regaining Indian's Economic Legacy\" and talked about the evolution of India's economy while suggesting ways to revive it.\r\n\r\nThe book was released by former President Pranab Mukherjee. Critical of the series of recent government measures to pull the economy out of the slowdown, Swamy also termed the previous five years of BJP rule as bad for the macro-economy.\r\n\r\n\"The government, in the last five years, has been doing things which are bad for macro-economics. The Prime Minister has done good works in micro-economics in Ujjawala, providing LPG connections to women in rural areas... But macro-economics is the whole system... and the whole system has been put into a mess which requires rectification and that can not be rectified by individual measures like reducing taxes for the corporate sector,\" Swamy told IANS in an exclusive interview.\r\n\r\n\"Abolishing income tax had been a very salutary (step), the middle class would have been very happy and they would have saved the money. The problem with corporate sector is that demand is low, so demand can only come when you empower the people, the people means income tax and that should have been abolished. Reducing corporate tax is of no use. Because they can only increase more supply but if there are no buyers, then there is no result in increasing supply,\" he said.\r\n\r\nEarlier, while speaking about his book, Swamy said: \"We need a new reset for our economy. We did not perform at macro growth level. The savings were inefficiently used. The country needs 10 per cent growth for 10 years if we have to eliminate unemployment.\"\r\n\r\nAsked why after so many steps, the situation has not improved as demand has not picked up, he said: \"Because Finance Ministers in our BJP government don't know any economics. That's the problem.\"\r\n\r\nResponding to a query if at the moment, the government is indulging in fiscal profligacy to come out of the current slowdown, he said: \"They don't even know what that means... the question in what they are doing is ad hoc. I have been writing since 2016 that this collapse will come. That time, people thought I was being critical, but now they know.\"\r\n\r\nSwamy said the country is heading towards a lower growth than 5 per cent but it can be turned around. \"The issue is we have to grow at 10 per cent for 10 years, then only you can solve the problem.\"\r\n\r\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in a big move on September 20, made several announcements for the corporate sector -- sharp cuts in corporation tax among a series of announcements that can cause total revenue forgo of Rs 1.45 trillion per year.\r\n\r\nAll domestic companies to be allowed to pay corporation tax at the rate of 22 per cent (effective rate 25.17 per cent including cess and surcharge) against the existing rate of 30 per cent. Any new domestic manufacturing company, incorporated on or after October 1, 2019, will be allowed to pay corporation tax at the rate of 15 per cent (effective rate 17.01 per cent). No MAT will be imposed on these companies either, and to provide relief to companies that continue to avail of exemptions and incentives, the rate of MAT has been reduced from 18.5 per cent to 15 per cent.\r\n\r\nThere is also relief to listed companies which have already made a public announcement of buyback before July 5, 2019 and no tax will be levied on buyback of shares in case of such companies.\r\n\r\nNow enhanced surcharge introduced by the Finance Act 2019 shall not apply to capital gains arising on sale of equity share in a company/unit of equity-oriented fund or unit of business trust liable for securities transaction tax, she announced and enhanced surcharge shall also not apply to capital gains on sale of any securities, including derivatives, in the hands of Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI).\r\n\r\nBefore this government announced sops for the export sector through export finance, for the real estate sectors, a bank consolidation drive by merging 10 PSU lenders to 4 PSU banks and withdrawing income tax surcharge on FPIs.\r\n\r\nSitharaman had announced withdrawal of enhanced surcharge on capital gains from equity for individuals, and HUFs. While presenting the Budget in July 2019, she had introduced a surcharge on individuals earning more than Rs 2 crore.","post_title":"Subramanian Swamy On Economic Slowdown Corporate Tax, Govt Macro-Economy","post_type":"post","post_author":"sahils","_thumbnail_id":"https://static.niklive.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/26074419/swamy-getty-580x395.jpg","post_url":"https://www.niklive.in/india-news/subramanian-swamy-on-economic-slowdown-corporate-tax-govt-macro-economy-1081009","post_modified":"2019-09-26T07:45:44+05:30","post_date":"2019-09-26T07:44:44+05:30","ad_disable":false,"auther-name":"IANS","is_forum_topic":false,"main_title":"Govt Messed Up Macro-Economy, Cutting Corporate Tax Will Yield No Result: Subramanian Swamy","category":["business","india-news"],"category_name":["BUSINESS","INDIA"],"post_tag":["economic-slowdown","subramanian-swamy"],"post_tag_name":["economic slowdown","subramanian swamy"],"post_format":[],"is_filmymonkey":"","comprehend":null,"all_category_data":[{"id":9,"name":"BUSINESS","slug":"business"},{"id":13205,"name":"INDIA","slug":"india-news"}]},"sort":[1569464084000]},{"_index":"english","_type":"post","_id":"1080996","_score":null,"_source":{"blog_id":"1","post_content":"<strong>New York:</strong> Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday (local time) chaired a meeting with member states of the Caribbean Community and Common Market (CARICOM) in New York on the sideline of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) and announced a grant of $14 million for several community development projects.

The trend of reduced prices on the back of recent corporate tax sops is expected to catch-up after car market leader Maruti Suzuki cut prices on Wednesday. There had been scepticism in the auto industry whether a cut in corporate taxes will lead benefit consumers. The government has yet not lowered GST rates for automobiles despite persistent demands by the industry.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the auto giant announced an immediate Rs 5,000 cut in prices of its bestselling cars including all variants of Alto 800, Alto K10, Swift Diesel, Celerio, Baleno Diesel, Ignis, Dzire Diesel, Tour S Diesel, Vitara Brezza and S-Cross. Besides, other companies such as Piaggio India and Isuzu Motors India announced festive season discounts.\r\n\r\nOn its part, Maruti Suzuki decided to reduce the price by Rs 5,000 on ex-showroom price, \"proactively and voluntarily\" sharing the benefits of cor porate tax reduction with customers. Maruti said it is optimistic that the price reduction will bring down the cost of acquisition, especially for the entry-level customers. This announcement around the festive season will help boost customer sentiment and revive the market to create demand.\r\n\r\nLast month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced several measures to rescue the auto sector, including lifting a ban on purchase of vehicles by government departments, and allowing additional 15 per cent depreciation on vehicles bought till March 2020 among others.\r\n\r\nHowever, the industry had demanded more measures, like reduction in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on automobiles from 28 per cent to 18 per cent, along with a vehicle scrappage policy. On September 20, Finance Minister Sitharaman reduced the effective corporate tax rates to 25.17 percent (inclusive of all cess and surcharges) from 30 percent for all domestic companies.\r\n\r\nThe development comes as the automobile industry suffers from a slowdown, caused by several factors like high GST rates, farm distress, stagnant wages and liquidity constraints. The industry's sales and production levels have dramatically plunged, leading to job losses. In August, all major OEMs consisting of passenger, commercial, two- and three-wheeler manufacturers have reported a massive decline in domestic sales.\r\n\r\nAs per Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers' August sales figures, the overall sectoral offtake in the domestic market has plunged 23.55 per cent to 1,821,490 units, from 2,382,436 units sold during the corresponding month of the previous year. Moreover, the industry has estimated that around 15,000 contractual manufacturing jobs have been lost and another million are at risk, if the slowdown is not reversed.","post_title":"Automobile Slowdown: Reduced Prices, Festive Offers To Accelerate Sales Growth","post_type":"post","post_author":"sahils","_thumbnail_id":"https://static.niklive.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/25225020/auto-sector-afp-580x395.jpg","post_url":"https://www.niklive.in/business/automobile-slowdown-reduced-prices-festive-offers-to-accelerate-sales-growth-1080980","post_modified":"2019-09-25T22:57:35+05:30","post_date":"2019-09-25T22:57:32+05:30","ad_disable":false,"auther-name":"IANS","is_forum_topic":false,"main_title":"Automobile Slowdown: Reduced Prices, Festive Offers To Accelerate Sales Growth","category":["business"],"category_name":["BUSINESS"],"post_tag":["automobile-crisis","economic-slowdown","festive-season"],"post_tag_name":["Automobile Crisis","economic slowdown","festive season"],"post_format":[],"is_filmymonkey":"","comprehend":null,"all_category_data":[{"id":9,"name":"BUSINESS","slug":"business"}]},"sort":[1569432452000]},{"_index":"english","_type":"post","_id":"1080945","_score":null,"_source":{"blog_id":1,"post_content":"<strong>Mumbai:</strong> Former India captain Sachin Tendulkar on Wednesday congratulated veteran Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan on being selected for the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award.

The party, which is facing existential crisis in Telangana, has left the decision to party national president N. Chandrababu Naidu. A section of TDP leaders feel the party should skip the by-election to save itself from embarrassment, others favour joining the fray to show it was still alive in the region.\r\n\r\nThe TDP didn't field candidates in the 17 Lok Sabha seats in 2019 polls. It was the first time since its formation in 1982 that the party stayed away from polls in the region. Analysts say, the TDP, seen as Andhra party by many, is almost finished in Telangana as it lost almost the entire leadership to the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) since 2014. In recent months, some has joined the Congress and others switched to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\r\n\r\nAfter making inroads in the Lok Sabha polls by winning four seats, the BJP is projecting itself as the alternative to the TRS and there is hardly any political space left for the TDP in Telangana, say analysts. The TDP is also demoralised after losing power in Andhra Pradesh. Though Naidu recently held talks with few party leaders from Telangana, the revival prospects appear bleak.\r\n\r\nThe TDP had contested the December 2018 Assembly elections in alliance with the Congress, the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS). The four-party alliance, led by the Congress, was humiliated as it could win only 21 seats in 119-member Assembly. The TDP bagged just two seats and one of the MLAs subsequently crossed over to the TRS.\r\n\r\nThe TRS, which retained power by winning 88, consolidated further by luring as many as 15 MLAs from the Congress and other parties to join its ranks. It's likely to be a direct fight between the TRS and the Congress in Huzurnagar constituency as the BJP is unlikely to make any impact.\r\n\r\nThat the TRS is taking the by-election seriously was evident that within a couple of hours after the announcement of poll, the party declared candidate. Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao, also the TRS chief, decided to again field S. Saidi Reddy, who lost the vote in December 2018.\r\n\r\nSaidi Reddy lost to Congress state chief N. Uttam Kumar Reddy by 7,466 votes. The by-poll is necessitated by resignation of Kumar Reddy from the Assembly after his election to the Lok Sabha from the Nalgonda constituency.\r\n\r\nThe by-election will be the first major test for the TRS, which suffered a blow in the Lok Sabha elections with the BJP and the Congress winning 4 and 3 seats, respectively. However, the TRS recovered by making almost a clean sweep in rural local body elections in June. Saidi Reddy will be locked in a keen battle against Padmavathi Reddy of the Congress. She is wife of Kumar Reddy. She had lost the Assembly elections from the Kodad constituency.","post_title":"Telangana Bypolls: TDP May Skip Elections Due To Existential Crisis","post_type":"post","post_author":"sahils","_thumbnail_id":"https://static.niklive.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/25215635/TDP-Getty-580x395.jpg","post_url":"https://www.niklive.in/india-news/telangana-bypolls-tdp-may-skip-elections-due-to-existential-crisis-1080935","post_modified":"2019-09-25T22:01:32+05:30","post_date":"2019-09-25T21:57:26+05:30","ad_disable":false,"auther-name":"IANS","is_forum_topic":false,"main_title":"Facing Existential Crisis In Telangana, Chandrababu Naidu's TDP May Skip By-Poll","category":["india-news"],"category_name":["INDIA"],"post_tag":["chandrababu-naidu","tdp","telangana-bypolls","telangana-elections"],"post_tag_name":["Chandrababu Naidu","tdp","Telangana Bypolls","Telangana Elections"],"post_format":[],"is_filmymonkey":"","comprehend":null,"all_category_data":[{"id":13205,"name":"INDIA","slug":"india-news"}]},"sort":[1569428846000]},{"_index":"english","_type":"post","_id":"1080931","_score":null,"_source":{"blog_id":"1","post_content":"<strong>Maninder Singh was the star for Bengal Warriors as they pipped Telugu Titans 40-39 in a tightly fought Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) match in front of a full house at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Wednesday.</strong>\r\n\r\nManinder scored 17 points as Bengal produced a clinical performance that catapulted them to the top of the points table. Siddharth Desai had an off day for the Titans despite scoring 15 points as the Telugu team all but killed their chances of making it to a playoff spot with the loss.\r\n\r\nThe first half was an evenly matched contest with both teams matching each other in all departments. Maninder was dominant in his raids for the Warriors, while Rajnish looked lively in the early minutes for the Titans. While Maninder's raiding skills deserved praise, it was a lucky mistake from him of going out of bounds, that resulted in the first real impact of the game as three Telugu defenders followed him into the lobby.\r\n\r\nThe lucky move proved decisive as Maninder produced a four-point raid in his next foray to secure an All-Out in the 15th minute of the match.\r\n\r\nBengal continued to dominate despite Siddharth's best attempts at reducing the lead and went into half time sitting on a 6-point advantage (19-13).\r\n\r\nTelugu started the second half like a team fighting to stay in the playoff race and the hunger showed in the early minutes with Siddharth picking up valuable raid points. Vishal Bhardwaj in defence looked his ominous best while Farhad Milaghardan's all-round abilities played a crucial role as the Telugu scripted a comeback. It utilised the momentum to secure an All-Out in the fourth minute of the second half to gain the lead in the match.\r\n\r\nManinder had his beast mode well and truly on after the All-Out, single-handedly annihilating the Telugu defence to restore his team's lead. The Warriors secured their All-Out with under seven minutes left in the game to move to a four-point lead.\r\n\r\nManinder and his teammates then held their nerves to clinch an important win.","post_title":"Pro Kabaddi League 7: Bengal Warriors pip Telugu Titans 40-39","post_type":"post","post_author":"gautaml","_thumbnail_id":"https://static.niklive.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/25162133/Warriors-580x395.jpg","post_url":"https://www.niklive.in/sports/pro-kabaddi-league-7-bengal-warriors-pip-telugu-titans-40-39-1080931","post_modified":"2019-09-25T22:29:11+05:30","post_date":"2019-09-25T21:51:33+05:30","ad_disable":false,"auther-name":"IANS","is_forum_topic":false,"main_title":"Pro Kabaddi League 7: Bengal Warriors pip Telugu Titans 40-39","category":["sports"],"category_name":["SPORTS"],"post_tag":["bengal-warriors","maninder-singh","telugu-titans"],"post_tag_name":["Bengal Warriors","Maninder Singh","Telugu Titans"],"post_format":[],"is_filmymonkey":"","comprehend":null,"all_category_data":[{"id":79736,"name":"SPORTS","slug":"sports"}]},"sort":[1569428493000]},{"_index":"english","_type":"post","_id":"1080926","_score":null,"_source":{"blog_id":1,"post_content":"<strong>Mumbai:</strong> An acid attack victim is finding new hope in life and has regained her will to survive, thanks to Bollywood actors Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon.

According to a report by news agency PTI,  South Western Command chief Lt Gen Alok Singh Kler while interacting with reporters on the sidelines of a first-of-a-kind seminar on artificial intelligence, at Hisar Military Station said there was \"nothing to worry\" at the moment.\r\n\r\n\"At present, the drones that you see being demonstrated at the event here, their capacity for carriage is very low. And, what we are hearing, the reports coming about drone being used across the border, their capacity is (also) very small,\" Kler said. A recent probe by Punjab police stated that GPS-fitted drones capable of lifting up to 10 kg flew in from Pakistan seven to eight times to airdrop the cache of arms, ammunition and fake currency seized in Punjab's Tarn Taran district.\r\n\r\nKler said the systems and radars of the Indian armed forces are in place. Another report by news agency IANS said that the weapons belonged to Pakistan-based Khalistani terror groups. The sorties, first of their kind in the state, were made between September 9 and 16. A terrorist, who has been arrested in this connection, has confessed that he was in touch with another Pakistan-based terrorist on the arms drops, report added.\r\n\r\nThe Punjab Police on Sunday claimed to have busted a terror module of the Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), backed by a group based in Pakistan and Germany. It said the terror group was conspiring to unleash a series of strikes in Punjab and adjoining states. Hisar Military Station is home to the 33rd Armoured Division of the Army. On use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Army, Kler said, \"From information to intelligence, direct destruction, for all such military capabilities, AI is going to be used\".\r\n\r\n\"Initially, it will be for constructive use, helping the commander take his decision. Taking an information and converting into intelligence, that is possibly the first usage of AI for Army in a constructive manner,\" PTI quoted him as saying.\r\n\r\nKler, however, added that soon army will have to take into account the disruptive use of artificial intelligence. A cache of arms, including five AK-47 rifles, and other material was also seized in the raid in border Tarn Taran district.\r\n\r\nGiven the international links and the ramifications of the conspiracy, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has decided to hand over further investigations in the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to ensure that the entire conspiracy is fully and expeditiously unraveled. He also sought Union Home Minister Amit Shah's intervention.\r\n\r\n\"Recent incidents of Pakistan-origin drones dropping consignments of arms &amp; ammunition is a new and serious dimension on Pakistan's sinister designs in aftermath of the abrogation of Article 370. Request @AmitShah ji to ensure that this drone problem is handled at the earliest,\" Singh said in a series of tweets.\r\n\r\nAltogether, five AK-47 rifles, along with 16 magazines and 472 rounds of ammunition, four Chinese made .30 bore pistols, along with magazines and 72 rounds of ammunition, nine hand grenades, five Thuraya satellite phones and Rs 10 lakh in fake Indian currency notes have been recovered from them, Police informed.\r\n\r\n<em>(With inputs from agencies)</em>","post_title":"Military Drones From Pakistan In Pubjab: Indian Army Says It Will Be Shot Down","post_type":"post","post_author":"sahils","_thumbnail_id":"https://static.niklive.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/25205053/army-getty-580x395.jpg","post_url":"https://www.niklive.in/india-news/military-drones-from-pakistan-in-pubjab-indian-army-says-it-will-be-shot-down-1080844","post_modified":"2019-09-25T20:52:47+05:30","post_date":"2019-09-25T20:51:31+05:30","ad_disable":false,"auther-name":"nik News Bureau","is_forum_topic":false,"main_title":"Military Drones Crossing Border From Pakistan Will Be Shot Down: Army After Weapons Dropped In Punjab","category":["india-news"],"category_name":["INDIA"],"post_tag":["indian-army","military-drones","pakistan"],"post_tag_name":["Indian army","Military Drones","Pakistan"],"post_format":[],"is_filmymonkey":"","comprehend":null,"all_category_data":[{"id":13205,"name":"INDIA","slug":"india-news"}]},"sort":[1569424891000]},{"_index":"english","_type":"post","_id":"1080842","_score":null,"_source":{"blog_id":1,"post_content":"<strong>New Delhi:</strong> The multi-starrer 'Housefull 4' has been hogging the limelight ever since its inception, and the makers of the film sure know how to the keep the audience on their toes for the much-awaited comedy riot.

I can’t express my joy. I want to tell my story because it will inspire couples to keep the faith and not give up hope, whatever their age is.” When the doctor revealed that Vandana was carrying twins, but during her third month, she was diagnosed with a condition and had to be hospitalised. A few months later, it came to light that the growth of one of our babies was very slow and finally, we lost him. The situation was such that we needed to go in for immediate delivery to save the other baby. Thus, our son was born three months before he was due. Vandana’s surgery did not go smoothly and she took a long time to heal; also, our baby was put in NICU (Newborn Intensive Care Unit) and was there for two-and-a-half months. The mother and son struggled throughout the journey, and finally, our little Krishna arrived home on Janmashtami. This is the most beautiful gift bestowed on us by the Gods.</em>\"\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B11ZT6pg1ks/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\">\r\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div>\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\"></div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;\"><a style=\"color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B11ZT6pg1ks/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Overwhelmed .. thank you for blessing the little one ????

He said that Pakistan has created an \"entire industry of terrorism\" to fuel unrest in Jammu and Kashmir and New Delhi can't talk to a country that sponsors terror.\r\n\r\nDuring an interview to Asia Society Policy Institute's President Kevin Rudd on Tuesday, he said: \"they have to accept the model which they have built for themselves, no longer works. You cannot in this day and age, conduct policy using terrorism as a legitimate instrument of statecraft that is at the heart of the issue. We have no problem in talking to Pakistan, we have a problem talking to terroristan.\"\r\n\r\nJaishankar also stated that Pakistan's reaction on the abrogation of Article 370 reflects its frustration and anger.\r\n\r\nAddressing a New York audience at cultural organization Asia Society Tuesday, he said when India decided to revoke Article 370 and bifurcate the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, it drew a reaction from Pakistan and China.\r\n\r\nPakistan downgraded diplomatic relations with India and also expelled Indian High Commissioner after New Delhi revoked the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir on Aug 5\r\n\r\nChina had voiced \"serious concern\" over the situation in Kashmir, saying \"the parties concerned should exercise restraint and act with caution, especially to avoid actions that unilaterally change the status quo and exacerbate tension.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Pakistan, it was a country which has really created an entire industry of terrorism to deal with the Kashmir issue... Who now says that the investments of 70 years are undercut, if this policy succeeds. So their today's reaction of anger and frustration is in many ways because they built an industry over a long period of time,\" said Jaishnakar.\r\n\r\nIndia on August 5 revoked Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, which gave special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. New Delhi's step did not go well with Islamabad which racked up its rhetoric against the former.\r\n\r\nPakistan's leadership, since then, has approached various countries and international organisations for seeking their support on the Kashmir issue. However, the international community has told Pakistan to directly engage in talks with India.\r\n\r\nJaishnakar further said that the revocation of Article 370 of the Constitution was necessary as it had become a 'barrier' and created a sense of alienation which led to separatism in the region.\r\n\r\n\"What was actually meant to help Kashmir ended up in a way where the bridge became a barrier. It had political and eventually national security consequences. Lack of development, an opportunity created a sense of alienation - alienation to separatism, separatism used for terrorism,\" he said.\r\n\r\n(with inputs from agencies)","post_title":"India Has No Problem Talking To Pakistan, But Cannot Talk To 'Terroristan': Jaishankar","post_type":"post","post_author":"shubhray","_thumbnail_id":"https://static.niklive.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/17202349/EAM-GEtty-580x395.jpg","post_url":"https://www.niklive.in/india-news/india-has-no-problem-talking-to-pakistan-but-cannot-talk-to-terroristan-jaishankar-1080594","post_modified":"2019-09-25T15:14:11+05:30","post_date":"2019-09-25T15:12:38+05:30","ad_disable":false,"auther-name":"nik News Bureau","is_forum_topic":false,"main_title":"India Has No Problem Talking To Pakistan, But Cannot Talk To 'Terroristan': Jaishankar","category":["india-news","world-news"],"category_name":["INDIA","WORLD"],"post_tag":["article-370","jammu-and-kashmir","pakistan","terrorism","terroristan"],"post_tag_name":["article 370","jammu and kashmir","Pakistan","terrorism","terroristan"],"post_format":[],"is_filmymonkey":"","comprehend":null,"all_category_data":[{"id":13205,"name":"INDIA","slug":"india-news"},{"id":13206,"name":"WORLD","slug":"world-news"}]},"sort":[1569404558000]},{"_index":"english","_type":"post","_id":"1080543","_score":null,"_source":{"blog_id":"1","post_content":"<strong>New Delhi: </strong>Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said if the NRC was implemented in the national capital, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari will have to leave the city first.

Trump.  “Howdy, Modi,” as the event was billed, has been described in much of the Indian and Indian American media as hugely successful and as another feather in Modi’s cap as he attempts to showcase India to the world and present himself as a ‘world leader’.  Prime Minister Modi, according to this narrative, had only one visibly uncomfortable moment when House Majority Leader <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2n9kxYh\">Steny Hoyer described India</a> as a country that, like America, was “proud of its ancient traditions to secure a future according to Gandhi’s teaching and Nehru’s vision of India as a secular democracy where respect for pluralism and human rights safeguard every individual.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Narendra Modi has taken every opportunity, both in India and abroad, to describe Gandhi in the most venerable terms.  He is astute enough to realize that Gandhi, whatever criticisms he may be subject to, still commands more cultural capital worldwide than any other modern Indian in history.  But Nehru is a different matter. Modi, as is now widely known, is outraged at the very mention of Nehru.  Dislike is too mild a word to describe the visceral hatred that he, Amit Shah, and the hardcore members of the BJP have developed for Nehru.  In this respect, too, Modi and Trump are joined at the hip:  if the very name of Barack Obama is anathema to Trump, whose policies often seen animated by nothing more than the desire to destroy the legacy of his predecessor, Modi is likewise dedicated to eviscerating the very memory of Nehru.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Also Read: <a style=\"color: #800000;\" href=\"https://www.niklive.in/blog/history-the-nation-state-and-self-liberation-a-gandhian-view-of-kashmir-1053870\">History, The Nation-State, And Self-Liberation - A Gandhian View Of Kashmir</a></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just hours before Modi took to the stage in Houston, <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/jawaharlal-nehru-responsible-for-pak-occupied-kashmir-says-amit-shah-2105201\">Amit Shah delivered a speech</a> before the party faithful where he declared Jawaharlal Nehru responsible for having created PoK, Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir.  It was a sight to behold as Modi stood by impassively while Hoyer had the gall to invoke <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2n9kxYh\">Nehru’s name a second time</a>, recalling the moment when, in his famous tryst with destiny speech, the country’s first Prime Minister called upon his countrymen and women to work together and honour Bapu with the resolve “to wipe every tear from every eye.”</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Steny Hoyer, who like other American politicians is innocent of the socio-economic and political realities of India, perhaps inadvertently marred what might have otherwise been a perfect celebration of Modi’s arrival on the global arena.  But supposing this to be the case, a few pressing questions about the “Howdy, Modi” carnival and what it says about the Indian American community and the cultural politics of the Indian diaspora in the United States remain.  First, and foremost, some people may be puzzled about why so many Indians were gathered to hear Modi and Trump when Indians, by a very large majority, are supporters of the Democratic party and certainly vote Democrat in a presidential election.  It may be said, of course, that they came to hear Modi; and, as we know, Trump announced his decision to join Modi only some days before the event.  But this does not occlude the all-important question:  is it possible that Indian Americans, even as they support the Democratic party, nevertheless feel something of an affinity for Trump, and would have turned out in the same numbers even if the event had at the outset been described as a Modi-Trump rally?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.niklive.in/blog/hong-kong-and-the-new-architecture-of-protest-1074031\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Also read: Hong Kong And The New Architecture Of Protest</span></strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The support of the Indian American party for Democratic candidates stems from their keen awareness that they constitute a minority in the United States.  It is only with the passage of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 that restrictions on the entry of Indians into the US were lifted. Not until the 1980s did something that may be called a sizable Indian community emerge, and for at least another two decades the feeling persisted among Indian Americans that they were all but invisible.  This feeling of invisibility is still there, even if it has been greatly attenuated by the entry of Indian Americans into the political sphere in the course of the last 10-15 years—though, it is also necessary to add, Indian American politicians such as Bobby Jindal and Nikki Haley barely, if at all, claimed recognition as Indian Americans and sometimes did everything within their power to disavow their connections with India.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The present scenario is doubtless more complex:  there are a large number of Indian Americans serving at all levels of the judiciary, and several have distinguished themselves as judges of federal appeals’ courts. At least two Indian judges, Sri Srinivasan and Amul Thapar, have apparently been considered for a seat on the Supreme Court, and Neomi Rao was sworn in earlier this year as US Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, which has been a stepping stone for those seeking elevation to the country’s highest court. Those Indian Americans—Raja Krishnamoorthi, Pramila Jayapal, Kamala Harris, and others—who have in the last few years made their way into national and state-level politics bear the marks of their ancestry with pride.  But none of this alters the fact that Indian Americans are still a small albeit fast-growing minority, constituting just a little over 1% of the American population, and as minorities they have sought to harness the power of the American narrative of pluralism and “equal rights for all” to their advantage.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is also necessary to register the unpalatable fact that the majority of Indian Americans have remained wholly indifferent to the plight of minorities in India itself.  Though two million Muslims in Assam now risk being rendered stateless, and “lynchings” of Muslims and Dalits over the last few years have unfortunately made India newsworthy, Indian Americans have generally shown themselves remarkably oblivious to the sufferings of minorities while they lose no opportunity to lay claim to rights as members of a minority in the US.  They would much rather gravitate towards the Republican party, which is more hospitable to business interests and free enterprise; but the party is also less accommodating to minority interests.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800000;\">More by the author: </span></strong><a href=\"https://www.niklive.in/blog/how-democracies-wither-the-bjps-constitutional-coup-detat-1050840\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800000;\">How Democracies Wither - The BJP’s Constitutional Coup d’état</span></strong></a></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is not the hostility of the Republicans to African Americans that troubles Indian Americans, and most Indian Americans accept—though many will not own up to this fact in public—the dominant white narrative which represents black people as, on the whole, lazy, insufficiently attentive to family values, prone to crime, and a liability to society.  But there is also the awareness that racism often extends to other minorities, and under Trump this feeling of insecurity has been heightened.  Indeed, Indian Americans view themselves as especially vulnerable in the present political climate, since revised immigration guidelines make it difficult for dependents of H1 visa holders—and Indians account for the bulk of such non-immigrant visas, handed out to people with specialized skills or professional expertise—to stay in the US just as henceforth extended family members are much less likely to be granted immigration visas. It is also a significant consideration that the community, again viewed in the aggregate and with awareness of the fact that there are also a considerable number of Indian Americans who live below the poverty level, is highly affluent and the majority of its members favor the Republican credo of “less tax”.  If there are few wealthy white Americans who will call for greater taxation of the very rich, there are still fewer Indians who would be prepared to advocate for such a cause.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus, if this should not already be transparently clear, there is absolutely no contradiction between the fact that Indians largely vote Democrat and their instinctive tendency to gravitate towards Republicans.  But there is another question that emerges from the comical “Howdy, Modi” show: is this a moment that signifies the “arrival” of the Indian Americans on the national stage and in American consciousness?  Many commentators would like to think so:  the journalist Sonia Paul, for instance, has characterized the event as a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/09/howdy-modi-rally-trump-divides-indian-diaspora/598600/\">“display of Indian Americans’ Political Power.</a>”  It may be that, but such analysis is toothless and uninstructive. Every minority of the size of the Indian American counts, and there are many such communities; but, viewed in relation to Hispanics and African Americans, Indian Americans are still far from being a highly influential voting bloc.  Hispanics and especially African Americans are embedded in the history of the nation in vastly different ways; many Indian Americans, even those who have put down roots in the US over two generations, still think of themselves as constituting the vanguard of India and would like to be important players in India itself.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But there is something else that Indian Americans must contend with before they start congratulating themselves on their emerging “political prowess”.  Americans remain fundamentally a provincial and insular people:  between their hamburgers and NFL games, cherry pie and cheerleaders, gargantuan SUVs and the big slurp, they have time for little else.  They remain blissfully unaware of what is happening in rest of the world:  the late-night comics are not the only ones to have noticed that some Americans would have a hard time locating Canada.  Central America, which Trump has described as a pest-ridden hell-hole which sends all its gang members and drug addicts to the US, would be nearly impossible for the majority of Americans to find on a map.  One can imagine in this scenario what India might mean to many Americans:  some decades ago, it mattered not an iota; today, it matters a little more, but still very little.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After having flaunted his 56-inch chest, Modi thought that he would dazzle with another display of muscularity by going on the “Howdy, Modi” rodeo.  He went from being a wrestler to a cowboy. That is the limit of his imagination—and the imagination of many in the Indian American community.  It will take something more than all this to turn Indian Americans into a truly viable political force in the US.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>(Vinay Lal is a writer, blogger, cultural critic, and Professor of History at UCLA)</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Disclaimer: The opinions, beliefs and views expressed by the various authors and forum participants on this website are personal and do not reflect the opinions, beliefs and views of nik News Network Pvt Ltd.</em></p>","post_title":"OPINION: “Howdy, Modi” And The Politics Of The Indian American Community","post_type":"blog","post_author":"shubhray","_thumbnail_id":"https://static.niklive.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/25141116/000_1KI74L-580x395.jpg","post_url":"https://www.niklive.in/blog/opinion-howdy-modi-and-the-politics-of-the-indian-american-community","post_modified":"2019-09-25T15:37:00+05:30","post_date":"2019-09-25T14:12:07+05:30","auther-name":"Vinay Lal","auther-profile-image":"https://static.niklive.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/22084617/Vinay-LalL.jpg","main_title":"OPINION: “Howdy, Modi” And The Politics Of The Indian American Community","post_tag":["houston","howdy-modi","narendra-modi"],"post_tag_name":["houston","Howdy Modi","narendra modi"],"is_filmymonkey":"","comprehend":null,"is_forum_topic":false,"ad_disable":false,"all_category_data":[]},"sort":[1569400927000]},{"_index":"english","_type":"post","_id":"1080523","_score":null,"_source":{"blog_id":"1","post_content":"<strong>New York:</strong> China had \"misread\" India's step to revoke Article 370 of Indian Constitution, said External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, adding that reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir will have no impact on China.\r\n\r\n\"I think the Chinese misread what was happening there.

In an update released on Wednesday of its flagship economic publication, Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2019, ADB said that proactive policy interventions along with a recovery in domestic demand and investments will likely see the economy pick up in FY20, growing by 7.2 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn July, ADB had forecast 7 per cent growth for FY19 and 7.2 per cent in FY20. India's fiscal year starts on April 1 and ends March 31 of the next calendar year. \"India will remain as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world this year and next year as the government continues to implement policy reforms and interventions to strengthen economic fundamentals,\" said ADB Chief Economist Yasuyuki Sawada.\r\n\r\nSignificant corporate tax cuts announced by the government on September 20 will uplift private investment including foreign direct investments and enhance India's global competitiveness. Bank recapitalisation, support measures for non-banking financial companies and cuts in monetary policy rates should improve the health of the financial sector while increasing the credit flow to industry and infrastructure projects.\r\n\r\nOther measures like direct income support for small farmers, tax relief for low-income taxpayers and reduced loan interest rates are expected to boost rural and urban consumption across the country. Fast-tracking of goods and services tax refunds should provide an important boost to small and medium-sized firms that have been constrained by a shortage of working capital.\r\n\r\nImplementation of these measures will brighten prospects for India's economy in FY20. Risks remain tilted to the downside given the weak global economy and, on the domestic front, the lag between growth-enhancing measures and the impact on demand.\r\n\r\nIndian exports are likely to be hit by subdued overseas demand and rising trade tensions and the current account deficit will be 2.2 per cent in FY19 and 2.5 per cent in FY20. The foreign direct investment could get a boost in FY19 and FY20 as trade tensions between the United States and China may push some businesses to move part of their operations to India.\r\n\r\nTo capitalise on this, the government would do well to improve the investment climate and further liberalise investment regulations, the report said. Inflation will be benign for both FY19 and FY20 at 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent respectively, both within the central bank target range, as food prices remain stable.","post_title":"Indian Economy To Grow 6.5 Pc In FY19, 7.2 Pc In FY20: ADB","post_type":"post","post_author":"sonaliv","_thumbnail_id":"https://static.niklive.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/25125124/gettyimages-1094011598-170667a-1-580x395.jpg","post_url":"https://www.niklive.in/business/indian-economy-to-grow-6-5-pc-in-fy19-7-2-pc-in-fy20-adb-1080459","post_modified":"2019-09-25T12:56:53+05:30","post_date":"2019-09-25T12:56:49+05:30","ad_disable":false,"auther-name":"ANI","is_forum_topic":false,"main_title":"Indian Economy To Grow 6.5 Pc In FY19, 7.2 Pc In FY20: ADB","category":["business"],"category_name":["BUSINESS"],"post_tag":[],"post_format":[],"is_filmymonkey":"","comprehend":null,"all_category_data":[{"id":9,"name":"BUSINESS","slug":"business"}]},"sort":[1569396409000]},{"_index":"english","_type":"post","_id":"1080486","_score":null,"_source":{"blog_id":"1","post_content":"<strong>Washington:</strong> US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump after a controversy erupted between him and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\r\n\r\n\"Today I am announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.
